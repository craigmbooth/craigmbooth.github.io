  excerpt: |
    I'm Craig Booth, a former astrophysicist now exploring the universe of education and technology. My journey began with supercomputer simulations of galaxy formation, fueled by an endless curiosity about the cosmos. Today, that same curiosity guides me in my role as CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co), where I strive to spark meaningful connections and inspire thoughtful innovation in education.

    This space is a reflection of that ongoing explorationâ€”where I share insights, reflections, and musings at the intersection of science, learning, and quiet wonder. I'm passionate about nurturing curiosity in myself and others, believing that each question leads us closer to understanding not just the universe, but ourselves.
