## October 2020

I live in Chicago, IL and am CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co).  I am very excited about the AI and NLP applications that we are building at the moment.

I'm currently trying to bake my way through every recipe in the Bread Baker's Apprentice (currently on Italian Bread), and am restarting running with Couch to 5k, currently on Week 6.

I wish I read more books.  I used to read on my commute, and now that I work from home, my reading has just dropped off a precipice.
