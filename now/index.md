# July 2022

I live in a suburb of Chicago with my wife, Samantha, and daughter, Violet, who is 10 weeks old now.  In my work-life am CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co).  I am very excited about the AI and NLP applications that we are building at the moment.

In my spare time, I continue to try and improve at logic puzzles, and would now consider myself a fairly solid intermediate solver. I also spend time baking bread, and learning how to maintain a house.

I still don't feel especially comfortable in crowds without a mask on.
