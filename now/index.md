This is a "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)", which tells you what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

## October 2020

I live in Chicago, IL and am CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co).  I am very excited about the AI and NLP applications that we are building at the moment.

I'm currently trying to bake my way through every recipe in the Break Baker's Apprentice (currently on French Bread), and am restarting running with Couch to 5k, currently on Week 6.

I wish I read more books.  I used to read on my commute, and now that I work from home, my reading has just dropped off a precipice.
