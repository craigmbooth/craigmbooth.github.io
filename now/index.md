This is a "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)", which tells you what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

## July 2020

I live in Chicago, IL and am CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co).  I am very excited about the AI and NLP applications that we are building at the moment.

I'm trying to absolutely nail the sourdough recipe from the Tartine book, and I bake at least a couple of loaves a week.

I wish I read more books.  I used to read on my commute, and now that I work from home, my reading has just dropped off a precipice.
