# April 2022

I live in Chicago, IL and am CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co).  I am very excited about the AI and NLP applications that we are building at the moment.

I have had a number of life changes recently.  My first child is due to be born this month, I got married, and I purchased a house outside of Chicago.  As I write this I am anxiously waiting for the baby and the move.

In my spare time, I continue to try and improve at logic puzzles, and would now consider myself a fairly solid intermediate solver. Most of my other hobbies have taken a back seat to preparing for a family.  I am antsy to pick baking back up after the move though.

I still don't feel especially comfortable in crowds without a mask on.
