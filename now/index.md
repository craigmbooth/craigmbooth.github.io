# March 2023

I live in a suburb of Chicago with my wife, Samantha, and daughter, Violet. Violet is now 10 months old, and she enchants me in every way.  In my work-life am CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co).  I alternate between being excited by, and terrified by the possibilities of generative AI.

In my spare time, I like to create foods, especially fermented foods (bread, beer, sauerkraut).  I still solve logic puzzles every day, and am getting gradually more competitive.  I am very ready for spring to arrive.

I still don't feel especially comfortable in crowds without a mask on.
