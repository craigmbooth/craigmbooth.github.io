## June 2021

I live in Chicago, IL and am CTO at [Packback](https://packback.co).  I am very excited about the AI and NLP applications that we are building at the moment.

I'm currently re-emerging into the world after COVID-related lockdown for a year.  I have recently made an effort to get consistently [better at logic puzzles](/blog/learning-sudoku/), and have started baking with ancient grains, and am trying to develop an intuition for how to use them in sourdough.  I have also started making my own fresh sausages, and am currently trying to document my approach to bread baking.

I still don't feel especially comnfortable in crowds without a mask on.
