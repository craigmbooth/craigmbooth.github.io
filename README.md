# Quickstart

``jekyll build`` builds the site and puts it in `_site`.  ``jekyll serve`` will serve it on port 4000

## Adding a post

Add a new file to ``_posts/blog/*.md`` and rebuild.

## Uploading

Check out craigmbooth.github.com and this repo.  Build the site in this repo, go to the root of craigmbooth.github.com and cp -r the contents of _site/ into that repo.  Then push.
