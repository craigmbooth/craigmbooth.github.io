# Quickstart

``jekyll build`` builds the site and puts it in `_site`.  ``jekyll serve`` will serve it on port 4000

## Adding a post

Add a new file to ``_posts/blog/*.md`` and rebuild.

## Uploading

Pushing to the master branch triggers automated rebuilds.  The CI badge above comes from running ``ci.sh``, which you can do locally.
