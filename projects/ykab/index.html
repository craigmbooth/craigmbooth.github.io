    <h1>You Killed a Bear But Now You’re Dying From Blood Loss: The Game</h1>

    <p>Great job!  You crept into a bear’s cave and killed it with your “bare” hands.  You will undoubtedly be the toast of the town and your husband will be delighted with his new fur coat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for you (the green dot), the bear took your left arm clean off and now you’re dying from blood loss.</p>

<p>Use the arrow keys to escape the cave by getting to the open blue sky (blue dot) before you bleed out.  You have 5 liters of blood inside you right now, but that number is creeping down with every step you take, and the floor of the cave is taking on an awfully “grisly” color...</p>
