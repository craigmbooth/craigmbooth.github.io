## Overview

### Episode 1:  Till's Quest

The party is summoned to the basement of a tavern by Till, who asks them to take a pendant and figure out how to destroy it.

As the team is debating whether to do this, the door is beaten down by thugs, the party escapes through a secret passage and escapes into the forest.  After evading a single guardsman who was on the lookout in the area, the party escapes into the woods.

After navigating the forest for some time, they find a glowing crystal surrounded by misty figures, and then a house -- out of place in the woods.

Two children outside of the house ask the patry to find their dead brother.  The party explores the house, working from the bottom up.  After battingling an animated suit of armor, the party finds the corpses of the two children who asked them for help, and a doll house that looks exactly like the house they are in.  Upon investigation of the doll house, the party notices a secret passage from the attic into the basement, and they follow it...


### Episode 2:  The Mossy Horror

The party arrives into a dank, circular basement.  Upon finding a lever, they pull it, and the room corkscrews downwards, leaving the stairs above them, revealing a crypt.  Akta finds the deed for a windmill (situated in the town of Elmwood) in a coffin, and the team moves towards the only notable sound in the basement.  Chanting.

Following the chanting, the party finds an Orc Barbarian being sacrified by a cult, and springs into action, saving him.

During the fight, the cult leader comands one of his lackeys onto a pedestal where he is killed, turning into a giant mossy horror.  The monster chases the party (and its new member, Keth) out to the surface, where the house no longer exists.

The party continues on its journey to the point Till told them to go, where they look at the sky and see a giant, flying castle in the clouds...

### Episode 3: Zora's House

The party rides the castle towards Mulmaster, and with the exception of a minor incursion by some cultists, have a peaceful time.  When they near Mulmaster, the party sees the night sky light up like an explosion.  On investigating, they find a crater made of black glass, and the remains of a town that used to be called Elmwood.  To the south of the town, Akta finds an abandoned windmill and is drawn towards a spot in the ground.  She digs and finds a box containing a mysterious whip.

The party moves on to Elmwood, and finds Zora.  A woman who looks *remarkably* like Till.  Zora tells the team she can help figure out how to destroy the pendant, but has a more immediate concern, the destruction of Elmwood.  She asks the party to investigate what happened there.  The only lead is a horribly burned girl who survived the blast and is being kept in a hospital.

The party spring the girl from the hospital and take her to Zora's house.  The girl is largely unresponsive, and when quizzed answers only with "Fire and ash".  While the party were investigating, Zora was researching and found that in wearing the pendant, Akta had attracted the attention of a creature known as a wandering crypt.

The wandering crypt is a kind of dungeon that moves and hunts by luring unwary adventurers underground.  At this point, Zora gestures out of the window to a building that wasn't there hours earlier, an entrance to the wandering crypt.

The party decides to rest before dealing with the crypt, but during the night the house is attacked by cultists, who manage to burn it down and kidnap the girl.  The party follows the cultist's trail to the outskirts of Mulmaster, where they find the cultists in an underground lair in the middle of a ritual.  A ritual being led by the burned girl!  After dealing with the cult and the demon they were summoning, the party rifles through their belongings and finds that the girl was responsible for the destruction at Elmwood, and that the cult is in some way related to the pendant that Akta is wearing.

The party returns to Zora's house, ready to head underground and face the wandering crypt...
