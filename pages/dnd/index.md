## Overview

### Episode 1:  Till

The party is summoned to the basement of a tavern by Till, who asks them to take a pendant and figure out how to destroy it.

As the team is debating whether to do this, the door is beaten down by thugs, the party escapes through a secret passage and escapes into the forest.  After evading a single guardsman who was on the lookout in the area, the party escapes into the woods.

After navigating the forest for some time, they find a glowing crystal surrounded by misty figures, and then a house -- out of place in the woods.

Two children outside of the house ask the patry to find their dead brother.  The party explores the house, working from the bottom up.  After battingling an animated suit of armor, the party finds the corpses of the two children who asked them for help, and a doll house that looks exactly like the house they are in.  Upon investigation of the doll house, the party notices a secret passage from the attic into the basement, and they follow it…


### Episode 2:  Mossy Horror

The party arrives into a dank, circular basement.  Upon finding a lever, they pull it, and the room corkscrews downwards, leaving the stairs above them, revealing a crypt.  Akta finds the deed for a windmill in a coffin, and the team moves towards the only notable sound in the basement.  Chanting.

Following the chanting, the party finds an Orc Barbarian being sacrified by a cult, and springs into action, saving him.

During the fight, the cult leader comands one of his lackeys onto a pedestal where he is killed, turning into a giant mossy horror.  The monster chases the party (and its new member, Keth) out to the surface, where the house no longer exists.

The party continues on its journey to the point Till told them to go, where they look at the sky and see a giant, flying castle int he clouds…

### Episode 3: Zora
