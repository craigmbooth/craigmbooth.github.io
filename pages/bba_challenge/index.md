## Intro

The [Bread Baker's Apprentice](https://pinchmysalt.com/the-bba-challenge/) challenge (BBA Challenge) is a challenge to bake all of the breads from the book Bread Baker's Apprentice, alphabetically from Anadama through whole-wheat.

That's what's happening here!

## #2: Artos:  Greek Celebration Bread

The second bread in BBA is a traditional Greek celebration bread.  Like the first recipe, I didn't expect to like this one too much (cloves, cinnamon, allspice are not my favorite flavors in general), but this was a delicious bread.

I chose to go with the Christopsomo (Christmas bread), just because the cross decoration didn't look too hard to do, and the flavors (walnuts, raisins, cherries, orange extract) sounded nice.  This was a real blast of Christmassy cheer, and is a bread I could definitely see myself making again for the holidays.

## #1: Anadama Bread

Anadama is a traditional bread in  New England that contains molasses, milk, and cornmeal (its history is not 100% certain, except it existed in Rockport Massachussetts by 1850).  I honestly didn't expect to like this one too much, since molasses is not a favorite of mine.  Overall, though, I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted like a slightly-sweet sandwich bread.

Not my favorite bread in the world, but happy that it worked.
