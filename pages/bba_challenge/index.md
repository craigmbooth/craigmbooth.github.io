## Intro

The [Bread Baker's Apprentice](https://pinchmysalt.com/the-bba-challenge/) challenge (BBA Challenge) is a challenge to bake all of the breads from the book Bread Baker's Apprentice, alphabetically from Anadama through whole-wheat.

That's what's happening here!

## #6: Challah

I was a bit intimidated starting this one.  Challah bread is not something I have ever eaten, and I assumed the braiding would be tough to get right.  However, after following the instructions, I was delighted when an airy, sweet, pretty looking bread dropped out the other side.

## #5: Casatiello

I was very excited to start this.  It is after all, cured meat and cheese in a bread loaf.  Unfortunately I ended up not liking this one too much.  The salami ended up too crispy for my taste, I would have liked more cheese, and the crust has more of a caky/pastry texture than I expected, likely because of how enriched the dough was with butter and eggs.  Overall I think I baked it pretty well, just ended up not being to my taste.  Meat and cheese in a leaner dough might suit me better and be something I should investigate.

## #4: Brioche

## #3: Bagels

I was pretty excited to try this one, since I love to eat a good bagel, and they have such a different texture from most breads.  Very many things in this bake I had never done before, from using high-gluten flour and a low-moisture dough, to boiling each bagel brielfy before baking it.

Overall they came out a little more flat than commercial bagles, but the taste and texture are definitely there.  I made bagels!

## #2: Artos:  Greek Celebration Bread

The second bread in BBA is a traditional Greek celebration bread.  Like the first recipe, I didn't expect to like this one too much (cloves, cinnamon, allspice are not my favorite flavors in general), but this was a delicious bread.

I chose to go with the Christopsomo (Christmas bread), just because the cross decoration didn't look too hard to do, and the flavors (walnuts, raisins, cherries, orange extract) sounded nice.  This was a real blast of Christmassy cheer, and is a bread I could definitely see myself making again for the holidays.

## #1: Anadama Bread

Anadama is a traditional bread in  New England that contains molasses, milk, and cornmeal (its history is not 100% certain, except it existed in Rockport Massachussetts by 1850).  I honestly didn't expect to like this one too much, since molasses is not a favorite of mine.  Overall, though, I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted like a slightly-sweet sandwich bread.

Not my favorite bread in the world, but happy that it worked.
