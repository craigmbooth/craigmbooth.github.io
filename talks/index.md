## Who Am I


### Big Data Course

<div style='vertical-align:middle; display:inline;'>
I spent a decade (2003-2013) working in theoretical astrophysics and high performance computing, as a PhD candidate in Durham, England and then as a postdoc in Leiden, The Netherlands and finally in Chicago. Somewhere along the way I realized that I loved the computing more than the actual astrophysics and made the decision to move into industry and work on new and exciting areas. I am currently a data engineer and coder based in Chicago, IL. I currently work at Narrative Science, and some of my personal projects are available on my blog.
