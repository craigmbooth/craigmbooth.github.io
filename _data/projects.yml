    tags: art,technology
    description: >-
      This is a quiet archive.<br><br>alienation.online collects fragments—articles, essays, images, artifacts—that capture a particular kind of discomfort. Most are about technology. Some are about the future. Others are about the strange feeling that something is slipping sideways beneath the surface of everyday life.<br><br>I don't update it on a schedule. There's no grand thesis. Just a slow accumulation of moments where the digital world feels too slick, too hollow, too fast—or just too much. These aren't always dramatic. Often they're small things: a glitch, a headline, a product pitch that feels slightly inhuman.<br><br>This site is where I hold onto those moments. Not to solve them, but to notice them.

  - title: AI Generated Experiments (2025)
    tags: software,art,visualization
    description: >-
      This is a space for exploring what happens when machines try to make things.<br><br>Every piece on this page is generated entirely by AI—not just images, but interactive works, small systems, strange little exhibits. I'm not curating for polish or perfection. I'm watching for signs: how fast it's improving, how weird it gets, and where it still falls short.<br><br>Think of this as a live sketchbook for something shifting. I'm trying to track the shape of what's coming.
