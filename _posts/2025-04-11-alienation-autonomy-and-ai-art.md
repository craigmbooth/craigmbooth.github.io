Lately, I've been thinking a lot about where the line between humans and machines lies—especially when it comes to creating art. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, this boundary gets blurrier. I'm left wondering what "art" even means in a world where creative works can be autonomously generated by algorithms.

To explore this uncertainty, I've been experimenting with AI as a creative partner. It's a nuanced issue: AI frequently acts as a leech, absorbing and regurgitating existing art, and I fully recognize and grapple with the ethical concerns this raises. Still, I'm deeply interested in discovering if AI might open genuinely new pathways and unexplored spaces for creativity.

In 2023, I created "A Way of Making Consequences for Behavior," a project designed to express my complicated feelings when AI first surged into mainstream consciousness. It's a series of AI-generated images and an AI-generated soundtrack reflecting alienation, paired with a contemplation on free will. In this project, my role was significant—I curated, guided, and iterated extensively. Honestly, I'm still not sure how well it captures what I intended, but it remains a genuine snapshot of my mindset during that transformative moment.

More recently, in 2025, I developed "A Map Without Edges," an experiment that pushes even further. This project tests whether an AI can independently weave together a coherent, ongoing narrative in real time. From a technical standpoint, it's also my experiment in complete AI autonomy: every single character of the website, from the initial concept down to the final line of code, was generated entirely by AI. Unlike the previous project, here I did little outside of the initial prompting, a reflection of how rapidly AI capabilities are progressing—a thought that's both exciting and a bit unsettling.

Both of these projects have helped me understand—or perhaps better accept—the strange new space we're entering. You can explore them yourself here:
