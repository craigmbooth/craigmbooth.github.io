When I was spending a fair amount of time travelling, I purchased a couple of cheap wifi-enabled security cameras to keep an eye on my home while I was out.  I had a great experience using those, although they have gathered dust in a box ever since the start of the COVID-related lockdown.  I happened to pull one out to keep an eye on my front door while I travelled to Michigan a few months ago, and realized while I was fooling around with the app that it had the capability to do timelapses and over the next few weeks I ended up setting up timelapses of a few of my hobby projects around the home.  With no further ado:

## Hydroponic Garden

Earlier this year I designed and built an aeroponic garden.  Here is a week of the plants growing while I was away from home.  It's genuinely surprising to me how much they move around to search out light.

## Sourdough Starter

I bake all of my household's bread, and have been [honing my technique](/pages/sourdough/) on rustic, country-style sourdough bread for a couple of years at this point.  This time lapse shows my sourdough starter for 12 hours after a feeding.
