There have been a large number of news reports about concussions in the NFL, and how it's "today's monster players" laying down big hits on one another that lead to this danger.  I decided to go into the numbers and take a look at this form myself.  Here's a graph showing the median weight of NFL players over time. This data was comes from about 16,000 players collected from [pro-football-reference.com](https://www.pro-football-reference.com)

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/blog/nfl_weights/weights_all.png" caption="The weights of NFL players since 1950" %}

There are a bunch on interesting features in this graph:

- The most striking thing is just the overall increase in weight since the mid-80s.  This is some combination of nutrition, weightlifting and steroids, although in what combination I don't know
- The wide receivers in particular are very interesting. Why did they go through a shrinking phase and then a growing phase? What was happening in the game that caused this?
- Running backs are getting shorter, but also heavier, showing that the game is evolving towards these guys being short, strong and powerful
- The weight of kickers drops until the 1980s then rebounds.  This is probably because (from Wikipedia) The kicker initially was not a specialized role. Until the 1960s, the kicker almost always doubled at another position on the roster.  Therefore the drop through the 1980s is the emergence of the specialized kicker, and the rise thereafter matches that seen in virtually every other position
- It's amazing how small the variation is amongst some of the positions. Plus or minus 6 pounds at 230+ pounds. Represents an incredibly specialized role.

Of course, this is only a small fraction of the story and the following gallery contains both the heights and BMIs of these same players, along with the weights broken down by position to show the scatter.  Enjoy!
