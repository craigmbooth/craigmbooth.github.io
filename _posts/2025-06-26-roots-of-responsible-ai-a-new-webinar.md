Today, a conversation I care deeply about is live for everyone to explore.

Earlier this month, I co-hosted a webinar called Roots of Responsible AI: An Educator’s Guide to Ethical Innovation. It wasn’t about the flashiest uses of AI—but about the real work of teaching: ethics, inclusion, pedagogy, and trust.

This session was built around a simple idea: AI in education shouldn’t just be exciting—it should be responsible. That means grounding every innovation in transparency, fairness, and a deep respect for the role of the teacher.

In the webinar, we unpacked key questions:

* What does “ethical AI” actually look like in the classroom?
* How can we design prompts that teach—not just generate?
* Where are the limits of AI, and how do we safeguard against them?

We covered practical frameworks, live demos, and ways to bring these ideas into your own instruction right now. If you’ve been wondering how to move beyond detection and into prevention—how to use AI to build student agency, not just catch shortcuts—this is for you.

I hope you’ll take an hour to watch the recording. The tools are evolving fast. The time to lead with purpose is now.
