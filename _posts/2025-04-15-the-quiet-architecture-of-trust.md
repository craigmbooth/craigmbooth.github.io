Today, something I've been quietly proud of was released into the world.

Back in November, I gave a webinar about AI in education—not the flashiest parts of AI, but the parts that really matter: ethics, pedagogy, and the quiet architecture of trust. That talk became a book, and I'm its author. Pulling Back the Curtains on Ethical and Pedagogical AI is now available as a free eBook on Packback's site.

This project matters to me because it asks the questions I think we all should be asking: What happens when AI enters the classroom—not just as a helper, but as a decision-maker? Who gets to understand the decisions it makes? How do we build systems that reflect the best of what education can be?

In the book, I tried to lay out a hopeful, rigorous, and honest path forward. One where AI is explainable. Where feedback is formative. Where students don't just pass—but grow. And where teachers remain at the heart of the learning experience.

If you've ever wondered what "responsible AI" actually looks like in practice—or if you just want to know what kind of future we're trying to build at Packback—I hope you'll take a look.
