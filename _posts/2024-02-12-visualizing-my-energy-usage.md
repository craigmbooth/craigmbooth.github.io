At the end of 2022, I got a solar system installed on my home.  Outside of feeling good that we're doing our little bit to help the environment (and save ourselves some money at the same time), I was excited to dive into the numbers

   * How much electricity I was generating?
   * how much I was using?
   * How much do I give back to the grid?

My solar system is an [Enphase](https://enphase.com/), and outside of the app, Enphase has a pretty solid API that I can use to pull down my data.  I wrote a little Python script that pulls down my system's data every 15 minutes and stores it in a database.  I've been collecting data for a little over a year now, and I thought it would be fun to visualize it.

## When We Generate Electricity

Each pixel here is an individual 15 minute increment.  The color of the pixel represents the amount of electricity generated in that 15 minute period.  The x-axis is the day of the year, and the y-axis is the time of day.

Rather obviously, the system generates most electricity in the middle of the day, and in summer and the dark vertical stripes correspond to very cloudy or snowy days.  One thing I liked about this plot is that it's very easy to see the days getting longer and shorter as the year progresses, and the little jumps in spring and fall when we change the clocks.

## When we Use Electricity

This heatmap is similar to the one above, but is now showing when we use electricity.  The color of the pixel represents the amount of electricity used in that 15 minute period.

The things that stand out to me on this chart are:

* Our biggest electricity hog by far is the AC, we see lots of vertical dark stripes throughout the summer as the AC kicks on and off.
* In August we purchased an electric car, and you can see the car charging in the evenings.  We initially charged it on a Level 1 charger, so you see long vertical stripes throughout the evening as it charged overnight.
* Towards ther end of the year, we started charging the car on a Level 2 charger, and you can see the charging time drop off significantly (the few dark spots all the way on the right)

## Net Electricity Usage

Same as above, but now showing when we sent electricity to the grid, or consumed it.  Throughout the year we had a slight net influx of electricity, driven largely by the fact that we bought an electric car.

## Next Steps

This exercise taught me a lot about our electricity use, and informed what I plan to do during 2024.  We plan to replace gas applicances (oven, water heater, dryer, furnace) with electric ones, so our electricity usage is only going to go up.  We already use slightly more than we generate, so I'm going to have to think about increasing our home's efficiency, I don't really have the appetite to install more solar panels right now!
