Philip Reich is a minimalist classical composer who, among very many
other things, has experimented with "phasing" in music.  Reich's
phasing works typically have two instruments playing the same line of
music.  One of the two instruments plays slightly faster than the
other so that they slowly go out of phase and come back into phase
with one another.  Here is a performance of Piano Phase

I have been fascinated by this music for many years and return to it
time and time again.  There is something in my brain that responds
very well to the shifting rhythms and patterns that a phasing approach
emits.  Over the past few weeks I've been on a bit of a Philip Reich,
William Basinski and Philip Glass binge while working.

Completely unrelated to this, I woke up this morning with the puzzle
solving sound from the Zelda games stuck in my head.  I have some very
definite memories of being unable to solve some puzzle in a Zelda game
for hours upon hours, and then when -- through blind luck -- I figured
out what I had to do, the little "Zelda Puzzle" sting would play and
I'd feel a real sense of accomplishment.  Here is that tune:

So, a few hours later I don't really know why I made this, but here's
a rendition of the Zelda Puzzle tune in the form of Philip Reich's
Piano Phase, <a href="/projects/reich">Zelda Phase</a>:
