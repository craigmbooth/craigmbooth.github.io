Over the past couple of weeks I have put together a couple of (I think) really cool data visualization projects, but they're not yet linked from anywhere on this website.  I'm fixing that right now.  Check these out!

### Map of Software

I used a web spider to crawl stack overflow for every tagged question.  I then used this data to construct a huge graph showing how all of the different tags are related.  In essence forming a topographical map of how all of computing is interrelated.  I then put this map into a zoomable, Google maps style interface.

### Interactive NFL Stats

I combined tables of NFL data with Google's chart API to produce a [Gapminder style](https://www.gapminder.org/) interactive visualization of how every team in the NFL has performed since the year 2000.
