## Overview
Thank you for signing up for SQL Bootcamp. Iâ€™m looking forward to an interesting and informative weekend building new skills together.  **Please come to the class with MySQL and MySQL Workbench already installed on your computer**

## File Downloads

This site will always contain the most up to date versions of the files related to this bootcamp

   * [The welcome email](README_FIRST.pdf)
   * [Instructions for installing MySQL and MySQL Workbench for Mac OSX](MySQL Installation Mac.pdf)
   * [Instructions for installing MySQL and MySQL Workbench for Windows](MySQL Installation Windows.pdf)
   * SQL files that we will need during the bootcamp
     * [load_data.sql](sql_bootcamp.sql)
     * [world.sql](world.sql)

We also provide some one-page SQL cheatsheets with succinct summaries of the concepts we'll encounter in class.  These files will be added to the website at the relevant points during the workshop

   * Cheatsheet 1:  [Create, Read, Update, Delete](SQLBootcampCheatsheet1.pdf)
   * Cheatsheet 2:  [Select, Sort, Group, Aggregate](SQLBootcampCheatsheet2.pdf)
   * Cheatsheet 3:  [Combine, Embed, Optimize, Normalize](SQLBootcampCheatsheet3.pdf)

## Resources

The following are the resources for further learning that I recommend during the class

   * [The MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide](http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-5-0-Certification-Study-Guide/dp/0672328127):  This book has been around for a while, but is still the most concise summary of MySQL concepts I've ever read.  You can pick up a used copy on Amazon for a couple of bucks.
   * [The OurSQL Podcast](www.oursql.com):  Over 200 episodes (around 20 minutes each), explaining different aspects of MySQL.
   * [MySQL Statements chart](http://www.visibone.com/sql/mysqlstatchart_1180.jpg):  An image that contains all of the MySQL statements.  Read each statement from left to right, things with a white background are ANSI SQL, blue background is MySQL specific.  Very confusing at first glance, but stick with it and there's a lot in here.
   * [SQLFiddle.com](http://www.sqlfiddle.com): A website with an interactive SQL terminal.  Specify some tables and do some queries, all in your browser.  Supports MySQL and other SQL dialects.
