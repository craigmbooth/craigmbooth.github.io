## Resources

The following are the resources for further learning that I recommend during the class

   * [The MySQL 5.0 Certification Study Guide](http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-5-0-Certification-Study-Guide/dp/0672328127):  This book has been around for a while, but is still the most concise summary of MySQL concepts I've ever read.  You can pick up a used copy on Amazon for a couple of bucks
   * [The OurSQL Pocast](www.oursql.com):  Over 200 episodes (around 20 minutes each), explaining different aspects of MySQL.
